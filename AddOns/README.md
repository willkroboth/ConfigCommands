# ConfigCommands AddOns

The base ConfigCommands plugin only supports [5 InternalArguments](../Plugin%20Description.md#internalarguments-provided-by-configcommands), but it also features an AddOn system for adding new InternalArguments and Functions. There are two sides of AddOns, development and usage, described below.

## Addons for Server Owners

Adding AddOns to the ConfigCommands base is as easy as adding any other plugin because each AddOn is literaly a plugin. Just download the Addon and put it in your plugins folder! It will be automatically detected and integrated into every feature of ConfigCommands: adding arguments, creating expressions, and using `/configcommandhelp`.

### Known Addons:
1. [NumberArguments](./NumberArguments/)
